# Project Constitution — Spec-Driven Development Workflow

This file is a workspace **Rule**: always-on context for every agent session
here. It defines the mandatory workflow for any prompt that changes the
codebase (code, tests, config, docs, deps — anything committed). Purely
conversational / read-only prompts are exempt.

---

## 1. Golden Rule

> **Plan → Issue → Branch → Implement → Secrets Check → Save Plan → Confirm Commit → Confirm PR**

Every code-changing prompt follows this pipeline. Steps 2/3 either create new
artifacts or reuse existing ones — see Section 7.

> **Project map:** Before navigating the codebase, read `PROJECT.md` for the
> directory index and go directly to the relevant path. Do not explore
> unrelated areas.

---

## 2. Step 1 — Plan first

1. Produce a short plan: what changes, where, why, and the chosen approach if
   alternatives existed.
2. Iterate with the user until it stabilizes.
3. The **final agreed plan** is what gets written into the GitHub issue
   (Section 3) and the plan file (Section 8) — not the first draft.

---

## 3. Step 2 — GitHub Issue (User Story format)

### 3.1 New work
New piece of work (Section 7) → create an issue:

- **Title:** short, descriptive, Title Case
- **Label:** apply the label matching the branch `<type>` (see Section 12.1)
- **Assignee:** the `gh`-authenticated user (`--assignee "@me"`)
- **Body:**

```markdown
## User Story
Refs: <link or ID of the existing user story this issue implements>

## Context
<1-3 sentences>

## Execution Plan
<finalized plan>

## Tasks
- [ ] <subtask 1>
- [ ] <subtask 2>

## Files Touched
- `path` — what changed and why
```

Keep tasks and "Files Touched" updated as implementation proceeds.

### 3.2 Continuing work
Continuation of an open issue on the current branch (Section 7) → **no new
issue**. Add a comment instead:

```markdown
## Update — <summary>

### Execution Plan
<plan for this follow-up>

### New / Updated Tasks
- [ ] <subtask>

### Files Touched
- `path` — what changed and why
```

---

## 4. Step 3 — Branching

### 4.1 New work
1. Fetch and check out **`develop`** (always branch from `develop`, unless
   the current branch is the relevant continuing branch — Section 7).
2. New branch name: `<type>/<short-title>_<issueNumber>`
   - `<type>`: `feature`, `fix`, `enhancement`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`,
     `test`, etc.
   - `<short-title>`: lowercase, hyphenated slug
   - `<issueNumber>`: the new issue's number

   Example: `feature/csv-export-reports_1`
3. Add the issue to the linked Project board and set Status → `In progress`
   (see Section 12.3) — work has now started.

### 4.2 Continuing work
Stay on the existing branch. Don't create a new one even if its PR was
merged — if deleted, recreate from `develop` with the same name.

---

## 5. Step 4 — Implement
Make the planned changes. Keep the issue's task checklist and "Files Touched"
list in sync as you go.

---

## 6. Secrets, `.gitignore`, and Environment Variables

### 6.1 While implementing
- Add any likely-sensitive file (`.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`,
  `secrets.*`, local config, build output, etc.) to `.gitignore` (create it
  if missing) before/while introducing it.
- Never hardcode secrets, keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings.
  Read them from environment variables. If a local env file is needed,
  maintain an `.env.example` with placeholder values only, and gitignore the
  real `.env`.

### 6.2 Pre-commit safety gate (before Section 9)
Before staging, scan the working tree/diff for sensitive files or values.

If found:
- Don't stage/commit it (unstage if needed).
- Add a `.gitignore` entry if it should never be tracked (flag separately if
  it was already committed/tracked).
- Stop, tell the developer what was found and why, then ask how to proceed —
  e.g. move to env var / secret manager, replace with a placeholder + gitignore,
  or rotate the credential if already committed.
- Wait for their decision before continuing to Section 9.

---

## 7. New work vs. continuing work
- **Continuing**: follow-up/fix/extension of the branch's current scope
  ("also handle X", "fix that typo") → reuse issue (3.2) and branch (4.2).
- **New**: unrelated feature/fix/enhancement → restart the pipeline: new plan
  → new issue (3.1) → new branch from `develop` (4.1).

If ambiguous, state your judgment before proceeding so the user can correct
it.

---

## 8. Step 5 — Save the plan to `/plans`

Once the plan is finalized and implemented, write it to `plans/` (create if
missing).

**Filename:** `plans/<sequence>-<branch-type>-<short-title>_<issueNumber>.md`
- `<sequence>`: global, ever-incrementing integer across the project (count
  existing files + 1; never resets).
- Branch name with `/` replaced by `-`.

Example: branch `feature/csv-export-reports_1`, 4th plan ever →
`plans/4-feature-csv-export-reports_1.md`

**Content:** enhanced summary of the prompt + agreed approach (not a
transcript):

```markdown
# Plan — <title>

**Branch:** <branch-name>
**Issue:** #<issueNumber>
**Date:** <date>

## Goal
<summary>

## Approach
<approach, alternatives considered>

## Changes
- <file/area> — <what changed>
```

A new plan file (next sequence number) is created for **every prompt**,
including continuing-work prompts — multiple files can share a branch/issue
suffix, showing the build-up of work over time.

---

## 9. Step 6 — Stage & commit (confirm once, at the end)

After the prompt's implementation is complete, ask:

> "Implementation is complete. Should I stage and commit these changes?"

- **No** → stop, leave uncommitted.
- **Yes** →
  1. Run `git status` to list all changed/untracked files and present the full list to the user. Ask the user to confirm or remove any files from the list. Once confirmed, stage only the final agreed list.
  2. Commit message:

```
<type>: <concise description>

<optional 1-3 sentence body>

#<issueNumber>
```

  - `<type>` mirrors the branch type (`feature`→`feat`, `fix`→`fix`, etc.)
  - Append `#<issueNumber>` plainly — never `Closes/Fixes #N` (a branch may
    get multiple commits across prompts).

---

## 10. Step 7 — Pull Request (confirm once, after commit)

If committed, ask:

> "Changes are committed. Should I push this branch and open a PR to
> `develop`?"

- **No** → stop.
- **Yes** →
  1. `git push -u origin <branch-name>`.
  2. Open PR `<branch-name>` → `develop` (via `gh pr create`, then GitHub
     MCP, then manual instructions — Section 11).
  3. PR body summarizes changes and references the issue (`Refs
     #<issueNumber>`, not auto-close).
  4. Update the linked issue's Project board Status → `Ready for review` (see Section
     12.3), signaling the reviewer it's ready for review.
  5. Agent does not review/approve/merge — that's a human reviewer's job.

If a PR already exists and is open, don't duplicate it — note that new
commits were added.

---

## 11. Tooling fallback order
For all GitHub operations:
1. `gh` CLI (assume installed & authenticated).
2. Connected GitHub MCP connector if `gh` unavailable.
3. If neither: tell the user what's missing and provide exact
   commands/content (issue, branch, commit message, PR) to run manually.
   Don't silently skip Sections 2–10 — surface the blocker and proceed with
   non-GitHub parts (branch via plain `git`, plan file, etc.) where possible.

---

## 12. GitHub Project Board Integration

Applies to issues/PRs in repos linked to a GitHub Projects (v2) board, e.g.
[Flutter - Event Calendar V3](https://github.com/users/Sinishaw/projects/2).

### 12.1 Labels (used in Section 3.1)
Apply the label matching the branch `<type>`:

| `<type>` | Label |
|---|---|
| `feature` | `feature` |
| `fix` | `fix` |
| `enhancement` | `enhancement` |
| `refactor` | `refactor` |
| `docs` | `documentation` |
| other (`chore`, `test`, etc.) | `enhancement` (default) |

If the label doesn't exist in the repo yet, create it first
(`gh label create`).

### 12.2 Assignee (used in Section 3.1)
Always `--assignee "@me"` — resolves to whoever `gh auth login`
authenticated, no hardcoded usernames.

### 12.3 Project status transitions
- **Issue created + branch checked out** (3.1/4.1) → add the issue to the
  Project board, Status → `In progress`.
- **PR opened** (10) → linked issue's Status → `Ready for review`.
- **PR merged** → Status → `Done` for both the issue and the PR item, and
  the issue should auto-close. This step happens outside any agent session
  (a human merges later), so it is **not** performed by the agent — instead,
  configure it once via the Project's built-in Workflows (⋯ → Workflows →
  "Pull request merged" / "Item closed" → set Status: Done).

### 12.4 One-time setup (per repo)
1. `gh auth refresh -s project` (default `gh auth login` scopes don't cover
   Projects v2).
2. Ensure labels `documentation`, `enhancement`, `feature`, `fix`,
   `refactor` exist in the repo.
3. Confirm the repo is linked to the correct Project board, and enable the
   "Done on merge/close" Workflows described in 12.3.

## 13. Quick reference

| Situation | Issue | Branch | Plan file |
|---|---|---|---|
| New feature/fix/enhancement | New issue (User Story) | New, from `develop` | New, next sequence # |
| Follow-up, same scope | Comment on existing issue | Same branch (reuse/recreate by name) | New, next sequence #, same branch suffix |
| Unrelated prompt mid-session | New issue | New, from `develop` | New, next sequence #, new branch suffix |
